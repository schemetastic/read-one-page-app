    html: `<h1>Mastering Component-Based Architecture: Building Scalable Frontend Applications</h1>

<p>Modern frontend development demands scalability, flexibility, and maintainability. <strong>Component-based architecture</strong> has become the foundation for building modular, efficient, and scalable applications by breaking the UI into reusable, self-contained components.</p>

<h2>Core Principles of Component-Based Architecture</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Reusability:</strong> Develop independent components that can be reused across different parts of the application, reducing redundancy.</li>
  <li><strong>Modularity:</strong> Break down complex UIs into smaller, manageable components to improve code organization and scalability.</li>
  <li><strong>Encapsulation:</strong> Isolate component logic, styles, and structure to prevent unintended side effects.</li>
  <li><strong>Composability:</strong> Combine simple components to build complex interfaces, enabling faster development and easier maintenance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Best Practices for Scalable Component-Based Applications</h2>

<p>To build efficient and scalable frontend applications, developers should follow these best practices:</p>

<ol>
  <li><i>Adopt a design system</i> to maintain consistency in component styles and interactions.</li>
  <li><i>Use state management tools</i> (e.g., Redux, Zustand) to manage shared data efficiently across components.</li>
  <li><i>Implement lazy loading</i> to optimize performance by loading components only when needed.</li>
  <li><i>Write reusable and generic components</i> to minimize duplication and simplify future updates.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Mastering component-based architecture is essential for developing scalable, maintainable frontend applications. By focusing on reusability, modularity, and encapsulation, developers can create efficient and adaptable user interfaces that support long-term growth.</p>
